# AnomalyDetection

Project aimed at finding anomalies in a data set using machine learning tools. First aims to predict future values with training and testing subgroups. The code implements a neural network to predict future values by training and testing on previous data. I wrote this code a week after engaging in extensive research into machine learning with Tensorflow. I had no prior experience in artificial intelligence, Python, or Tensorflow prior to starting this project.
